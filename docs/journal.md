Planning.

General idea:
- I want to create a visual representation of the relationship between beam diameter and focal point.
- I am considering how I will need to simulate the interference of the beam - I did a homework on this, using the directivity function, which I should check.
- Right now, the components I need are:
  - Simulated beam with or without separate elements, with possibility of inputting different diameters
  - Plot of beam (2D?)
  - An animation of beam with different distances
  - An interactive animation where distance can be adjusted

First steps:
- [ ] Check the directivity function homework I did, and adapt that code
- [ ] Read slides/textbook on this to supplement code
